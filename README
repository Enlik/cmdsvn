cmdsvn - interactive command line browser for Subversion repositories

Think of it as a subset of TortoiseSVN that works on the command line.
Requires GNU bash and Subversion command client.

Invocation
==========

cmdsvn
or
cmdsvn <repository URI>
and what commands are available depends on the configuration file.
This part is extensible; see cmdsvn.cfg.example for an example.
The file also explains the format and available functions.

Configuration
=============

By default, cmdsvn looks for .cmdsvn.cfg in your home directory, or whatever
is in CMDSVN_CONFIG. The latter takes priority.

Note: configuration allows to run arbitrary (but user defined) commands.
Don't use configuration from untrusted sources.

If no configuration file can be found, a few built in commands are defined.
Consider renaming cmdsvn.cfg.example as ~/.cmdsvn.cfg for more functionality.

The format, available functions and variables is explained in the file
configuration.txt.

Why?
====

Because traversing a Subversion repository using multiple 'svn ls' command
executions is not comfortable.
