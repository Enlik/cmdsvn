This file explains format of the configuration file for cmdsvn.

# This is a comment. Comments start with a hash symbol.

The format is: <command>:<spec>
and spaces after the colon are ignored to allow for readable formating
of the file.

Empty lines are ignored.

A command may accept at most one parameter, denoted by %a on the left side.
The paramter %a is accessible using variable %a% on the right side. Spaces
and special characters are preserved in the parameter.

List of functions
=================

list-cmds     Prints a list of defined commands.
list-items    Prints items in the current location (using svn list). Basically
              it's the same as if "exec svn list %uri%" was used, except that
              it remembers the output for the current location until the
              location is changed.
quit          Quits.
echo ARG      Prints ARG.
go-to         Adds a directory to the stack.
go-to-match   Adds a directory to the stack. Accepts bash patterns. If there
              are many matches, an interactive prompt is displayed.
go-up         Pops the directory stack.
switch-repo ARG
              Sets ARG as new repository root.
exec          Executes a command (external application, usually, but not
              limited to, svn).
pager         As above, but pipes the output to the pager.
chain         Use it to "chain" commands (execute a few of them with one
              command) or create aliases. Commands are separated by a plus
              character, optionally separated by spaces for better
              readability.


List of variables
=================

They are accessible on the right side.
%a%          Argument (%a on the left side).
%uri%        Current URI.
